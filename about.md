# About

I perpetually seek out new things to learn and new ways to grow as a person.  Being autistic and having ADHD are two parts of my recipe that contribute to my tendency to obsess over the little things, ultimately see the bigger picture, and fuel my curiosity as I hyperfocus on a regular basis.  


# Recent Projects and Repositories

Here are a list of projects that I am actively working on or have worked on in the past.

- Legacy <a href="https://github.com/cfornesa/projects">"Projects"</a> project.  My first attempt at creating a GitHub page, it is also where this page was originally hosted prior to creating the "cfornesa.github.io" repository.


# Jupyter Notebooks

## Fornesus Blog Web Scraping Project

April 13, 2024

This Jupyter notebook reviews the steps that I took in creating my first web scraping project, using BeautifulSoup4 and Requests Python libraries to scrape data from three of my websites.  I also went through the ways in which I integrated GitHub Copilot in this workflow, though I will state that a solid foundation in Python was still necessary for me to refactor this code as efficiently as possible.  You can find the associated Colab Notebook <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eN4B4I5J6PJYnN-1MG6ma7JtPyEVKgtK/view?usp=sharing">at this link</a>.

Links to a live web output of each of the three tests can be found at the following links:
