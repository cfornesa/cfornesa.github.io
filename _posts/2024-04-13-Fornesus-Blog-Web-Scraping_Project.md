This Jupyter notebook reviews the steps that I took in creating my first web scraping project, using BeautifulSoup4 and Requests Python libraries to scrape data from three of my websites. I also went through the ways in which I integrated GitHub Copilot in this workflow, though I will state that a solid foundation in Python was still necessary for me to refactor this code as efficiently as possible.
