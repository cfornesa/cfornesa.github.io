## What I Do
I perpetually seek out new things to learn and new ways to grow as a person. Being autistic and having ADHD are two parts of my recipe that contribute to my tendency to obsess over the little things, ultimately see the bigger picture, and fuel my curiosity as I hyperfocus on a regular basis.

## Recent Projects and Repositories

Here are a list of projects that I am actively working on or have worked on in the past.

- <a href="https://github.com/cfornesa/hello-world">"Hello World"</a> project. My first assignment for MOD A of Buston University's Online MSDS program.
- <a href="https://github.com/cfornesa/introduction-to-github">"Introduction to GitHub"</a> project. A GitHub Skills project where I practice creating a repo, then branching and merging changes.
- <a href="https://github.com/cfornesa/communicate-using-markdown">"Communicate using markdown"</a> project. A GitHub Skills project where I practice communicating with markdown.
- Legacy <a href="https://github.com/cfornesa/projects">"Projects"</a> project. My first attempt at creating a GitHub page, it is also where this page was originally hosted prior to creating the "cfornesa.github.io" repository.
